PATOOL(1)                                                    PATOOL(1)



NAME
       patool - portable archive file manager for the commandline con‐
       sole

SYNOPSIS
        patool        [global-options]         (list|test|extract|cre‐
       ate|diff|search|repack|formats)   [command-options]   <command-
       arguments>...

DESCRIPTION
       Various archive formats  can  be  created,  extracted,  tested,
       listed,  searched,  repacked and compared by patool. The advan‐
       tage of patool is its  simplicity  in  handling  archive  files
       without having to remember a myriad of programs and options.

       The  archive format is determined by the file(1) program and as
       a fallback by the archive file extension.

       patool supports 7z (.7z), ACE (.ace), ADF (.adf), ALZIP (.alz),
       APE  (.ape), AR (.a), ARC (.arc), ARJ (.arj), BZIP2 (.bz2), CAB
       (.cab), compress (.Z), CPIO (.cpio), DEB  (.deb),  DMS  (.dms),
       FLAC  (.flac), GZIP (.gz), LRZIP (.lrz), LZH (.lha, .lzh), LZIP
       (.lz), LZMA (.lzma), LZOP (.lzo), RPM (.rpm), RAR (.rar),  RZIP
       (.rz),  SHN  (.shn), TAR (.tar), XZ (.xz), ZIP (.zip, .jar) and
       ZOO (.zoo) formats.  It relies on helper applications to handle
       those archive formats (for example bzip2 for BZIP2 archives).

       The  archive  formats  TAR,  ZIP,  BZIP2 and GZIP are supported
       natively  and  do  not  require  helper  applications   to   be
       installed.

EXAMPLES
         patool extract archive.zip otherarchive.rar
         patool --verbose test dist.tar.gz
         patool list package.deb
         patool --verbose create myfiles.zip file1.txt dir/
         patool diff release1.0.tar.xz release2.0.zip
         patool search "def urlopen" python-3.3.tar.gz
         patool repack linux-2.6.33.tar.gz linux-2.6.33.tar.bz2

GLOBAL OPTIONS
       -v, --verbose
              Display  more  info  about what patool does, and display
              the output of helper applications. Can be given multiple
              times to increase the output even more.

COMMANDS
       The following rules apply to all commands:

       ·   Existing files are never overwritten.

       ·   The original archive will never be removed.

       ·   Files  outside  the  outut directory will never be created.
           This relies on archive program options to prevent unpacking
           of  files  with  an  absolute  path  name  (eg.  --no-abso‐
           lute-filenames for cpio(1)).

       The following commands are available.

   extract
       patool extract [--outdir directory] <archive>...

       Extract files from given archives. The original  archives  will
       never be removed and are left as is.

       --outdir directory
              Extract  to  the  given  output directory. Default is to
              extract to the current working directory.

       If the archive contains exactly one file or directory, the  ar‐
       chive  contents are extracted directly to the output directory.
       Else the files are extracted in a newly created subdirectory of
       the  output directory. The new directory is named after the ar‐
       chive filename without the extension.
       This prevents cluttering the output directory  with  a  lot  of
       files from the extracted archive.

       All  extracted  files are ensured that they are readable by the
       current user.

   list
       patool list <archive>...

       List files in archives.

   create
       patool create <archive> <file-or-directory>...

       Create an archive from given files. All of the given  files  to
       add  to  the archive must be readable by the current user.  The
       format of the archive to create is determined  by  the  archive
       file extension.

   test
       patool test <archive>...

       Test  the  given  archives.  If the helper application does not
       support testing, the archive contents are listed instead.

   diff
       patool diff <archive1> <archive2>

       Show differences between two archives with the diff(1) program.
       The diff options used are -urN.

   search
       patool search <pattern> <archive>

       Search  in archive contents for given pattern using the grep(1)
       program.  The grep options used are -r; additional options  can
       be supplied with the GREP_OPTIONS environment variable.

   repack
       patool repack <archive> <archive_new>

       Repackage  archive  to  a  different format. The target archive
       format is determined by the file extension of archive_new.

   formats
       patool formats

       Show all supported archive formats (ie. which  helper  applica‐
       tions are available).

HELP OPTION
       Specifying  the help option displays help for patool itself, or
       a command.
       For example:
         patool --help - display help for patool
         patool extract --help - display help for the extract command
